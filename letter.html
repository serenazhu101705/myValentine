    <p>Jacklyn,</p>
    <p>
      Where do I even begin? If I told myself last Christmas that would’ve
      been the last Christmas I spent without you, I would’ve died a happy
      woman that day. This past year has been filled with so much for us, and
      sometimes I still can’t believe you finally said yes to me. For as long
      as I can remember having you in my life, all I’ve wanted is for you to
      be with me. And maybe in the beginning I liked you because you were the
      most beautiful girl I’d ever seen in orchestra, but as I got to know you
      more, I found myself growing more and more attached every day. You became
      the center of my world: the voice that wouldn’t stop talking my ear off
      became my comfort, the lips that wouldn’t stop moving became my every
      desire, the eyes that sparkled when you smiled and laughed became my
      very definition of beauty. I fell in love. I found my mind wandering
      constantly to you — I couldn’t stop looking at your photos, watching your
      vlogs, listening to your voice. I wrote secret love letters to you after
      you had fallen asleep, knowing I would never have the courage to send
      them to you but unable to stop thinking about you and unwilling to forget
      the passion I so strongly felt for a girl who was so oblivious to my love
      for her. And so, I wrote them down. I knew I could never deserve you, yet
      I wanted you more and more every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I finally confessed my feelings to you, I didn’t hear the answer I
      wanted, and it devastated me. So many emotions clashed in my heart:
      anger, sadness, confusion, defeat, embarrassment. It was one of the
      most difficult things I had ever done; not only had I confessed my love
      for someone who I knew didn’t reciprocate, it was the first time I had
      ever been truly honest with someone else about my sexuality. I was
      terrified of what you would think or say and angry that I had been
      deceived. And yet, even after all of that, I couldn’t let you go. I
      dreamt of you every night after that, I thought about you every second of
      the day; no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t let you go, couldn’t let
      you be hurt, couldn’t imagine the thought of you being with anyone else
      but me. Watching you so torn and devastated over not loving me back, I
      put my feelings aside and told myself I would move on, for the sake of
      us.
    </p>

      Yesterday, you told me how hard you tried to love someone else that wasn’t
      me when we first went off to college. You expected me to be angry, but I
      want to let you know I understand. I sympathize with you for doing so; I
      too tried to love someone else that wasn’t you, anyone else that wasn’t
      you, for the sake of keeping you in my life because I knew I could never
      watch you be with someone else and I couldn’t just let you go. At times,
      it got extremely difficult; I felt lonely, desperate, angry, and so, so,
      so sad. But after many failed attempts, I realized that at the end of
      every day, you were still all that I wanted. I could never desire someone
      else in the same way I desired you, no matter how hard I tried. They never
      stuck in my mind the way you did, and I couldn’t want them like I wanted
      you. I chose you; I always chose you. When we went to college, I knew in
      the back of my mind you were trying to move on from me, and initially, it
      made me very angry. But I realized that you chose me, just like I chose
      you. There was never anyone else that I could ever build my life with.
    </p>
    <p>I love you, Jacklyn. There isn't anything else I would ever ask for in the world, if only I could have you for an eternity. I will love you no matter what, whether you have lost your mind or no longer love me, I will love you until the day I die. You are the love of my life; what more could I ever ask for?</p>
    <p>Your love, </p>
    <p>Serena</p>
